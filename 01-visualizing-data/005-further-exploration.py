# For Further Exploration

# • seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and allows you to easily produce prettier
# (and more complex) visualizations.

# • D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing sophisticated interactive visualizations
# for the web. Although it is not in Python, it is both trendy and widely used, and it
# is well worth your while to be familiar with it.

# • Bokeh is a newer library that brings D3-style visualizations into Python.

# • ggplot is a Python port of the popular R library ggplot2 , which is widely used for
# creating “publication quality” charts and graphics. It’s probably most interesting
# if you’re already an avid ggplot2 user, and possibly a little opaque if you’re not.
